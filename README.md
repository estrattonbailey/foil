# foil
700 byte framework agnostic universal router.

## Features
1. Simple
2. Nestable
3. Middleware
4. Universal

## Install
```bash
npm i foil --save
```

# Usage
```javascript
import { router, route } from 'foil'

const app = router(
  route({
    path: '/',
    payload: {
      // ...
    }
  }),
  route({
    path: '*',
    payload: {
      // 404
    }
  })
)

app.resolve('/', ({ payload, context, redirect }) => {
  // rendering logic
})
```

## Defining routes
Routes should be defined with both `path` and `payload` properties.
- `path` - a path representing the route, including named parameters
- `payload` - an object to be returned when the route is matched

```javascript
import { route } from 'foil'

const path = '/'

const payload = {
  // ...
}

export default route({
  path,
  payload
})
```

### Parameters
Routes can be defined with simple parameters. When matched, these params will be returned on the `context` object. Only named parameters (`:slug`) and wildcards (`*`) are supported at this time.
```javascript
import { router, route } from 'foil'

const app = router(
  route({
    path: '/:slug',
    payload: {
      // ...
    }
  })
)

app.resolve('/hello', ({ payload, context }) => {
  console.log(context.params) // => { slug: 'hello' }
})
```

### Context
Context is created when a route is matched. It contains the following properties and methods:
- `params` - an `object` containing any matched route parameters, defaults to an empty `{}`
- `location` - a `string` representing the full path that was matched
- `redirect` - a `function` that accepts a redirect location

### Nested routes
Routes can be nested by passing a route to the function returned from the parent route. Nested routes build on the paths of their parents.

This means that certain generic routes can be reused in different locations. The code below results in four separate routes: `/about`, `/about/:slug`, `/posts`, and `/posts/:slug`.
```javascript
import { router, route } from 'foil'

const About = route({
  path: '/about',
  payload: {}
})

const Posts = route({
  path: '/posts',
  payload: {}
})

const Lightbox = route({
  path: ':slug',
  payload: {}
})

export default router(
  About(
    Lightbox
  ),
  Posts(
    Lightbox
  )
)
```

## Middleware
`foil` implements very simple "middleware". Middleware functions are defined with the `use` export from `foil`. They are executed on each route transition for the route scope in which they are defined, and all nested scopes. Middleware are passed the complete context of the route matched.

Below, the `root` middleware will be called when the `Home` route is matched. When either `Posts` or `Post` are matched, *both* `root` and `nested` will fire.
```javascript
const root = use(context => // ...)
const nested = use(context => // ...)

export default router(
  root,
  Home,
  Posts(
    nested,
    Post
  )
)
```

## Redirects
Redirects in `foil` happen via the `context` object and its `redirect` method. The easiest approach is to define a middleware that handles some or all redirects for your application.
```javascript
import { router, route, use } from 'foil'

const redirectMiddleware = use(context => {
  const { location } = context

  if (location === '/some-path') {
    return context.redirect('/some-other-path')
  } else if (...) {
    // etc
  }
})

const app = router(
  redirectMiddleware,
  // ... routes
)
```

If a redirect is issued via `context.redirect()`, the `redirect` prop passed to your `app.resolve()` callback will contain `to` and `from` properties that tell you where the redirect occurred:
```javascript
app.resolve('/some-path', ({ payload, context, redirect }) => {
  console.log(redirect) // { to: '/some-other-path', from: '/some-path' }
})
```

### Protected Routes
A route or a group of routes can also easily be protected using this same pattern.
```javascript
import { router, route, use } from 'foil'
import store from './store.js' // whatever you want to use

const app = router(
  route({
    path: '/'
    payload: {}
  }),
  route({
    path: '/login',
    payload: {}
  })
  route({
    path: '/account',
    payload: {}
  })(
    use(context => {
      if (!store.state.user) {
        return context.redirect('/login')
      }
    }),
    route({
      path: '/:order',
      payload: {}
    })
  )
)
```

## Server Side Rendering
```javascript
const server = require('express')()
const app = require('./app.js')

server.get('*', (req, res) => {
  app.resolve(req.originalUrl, ({ payload, context, redirect }) => {
    if (redirect.to) {
      res.redirect(redirect.to)
    } else {
      res.send(// render logic)
    }
  })
})

server.listen(8080)
```

# Usage with Other UI Libraries
- React - [@foil/react](https://github.com/estrattonbailey/foil-react)

# About the Name
I like the word *foil* as a figurative term, as in *to set off by contrast*. In the context of routing in React (which is my main motivation behind this library, see [@foil/react](https://github.com/estrattonbailey/foil-react)), `foil` is a bit of a departure from many of the more well established patterns.

Many thanks to [jkuri](https://github.com/jkuri) for letting me use the npm package name! Very kind of him :)
